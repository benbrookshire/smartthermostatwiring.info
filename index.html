				<h2>Is this for me?</h2>
			</div>
			<p>I felt this way too, when I removed the face plate of my old thermostat. Wire colors were unclear, and there seemed
            to be some wires missing! I explored various resources on how smart thermostats are wired, and worked up a
            basic understanding of how "single stage" air conditioners are wired up.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for a quick and simple 1-2 steps this might not be for you, but in my case there wasn't
            a 1-2 step process that would work. So let's dive in - what does it take to rewire your air handler
            to support a newer "smart" thermostat?</p>

				<h2>Terminology</h2>
				<span class="byline">First, let's cover some basic terminology.</span> </div>
			<div class="column1">
				<div class="box">
					<span class="icon icon-wrench"></span>
					<h3>Thermostat</h3>
					   <p>This is the only part of your air conditioner that you typically interact with -
                        typically a small white box approx. 4x6x1 inches that reads out the current room temperature
                        and let's you adjust the temperature for you air conditioner, making it warmer or cooler.</p>
					<!-- <a href="#" class="button button-small">Etiam posuere</a> -->
                </div>
			</div>
			<div class="column2">
				<div class="box">
					<span class="icon icon-wrench"></span>
					<h3>Air handler</h3>
					   <p>This is the large unit typically hidden away inside your home in an attic or closet space.
                        It draws in air from your house and cools or warms the air and passes the air through ductwork into 
                        various rooms in your house.</p>
					<!-- <a href="#" class="button button-small">Etiam posuere</a> -->
                </div>
			</div>
			<div class="column3">
				<div class="box">
					<span class="icon icon-wrench"></span>
					<h3>Condenser</h3>
                        <p>This is the large loud unit outside your house, typically in your back or side yard. It kicks on
                        at the same time as your air handler when you're cooling your house, and works together to remove heat
                        from the air inside your house, and dump that heat outside.</p>
					<!-- <a href="#" class="button button-small">Etiam posuere</a> -->
                </div>
			</div>
			<div class="column4">
				<div class="box">
					<span class="icon icon-wrench"></span>
					<h3>Wiring</h3>
                        <p>These three systems - thermostat, air handler, and condenser all interact via stranded
                        copper wiring that connects them. Ideally a 5 strand wire connects your thermostat with
                        your air handler, and a 2 strand wire connects your air handler to the condenser. These wires 
                        are not passing digital signals, they simple pass low-voltage in various closed-circuit
                        configurations to control the three systems.</p>

		<h2>Why rewire?</h2>
            <span class="byline">Rewiring may be necessary when existing wiring is incompatible.</span> </div>
            <p>In many cases rewiring your thermostat to allow installation of a smart thermostat isn't necessary. When
            would it be necessary?</p>
            <p>Old thermostats were often run off of batteries stored in the back of the thermostat unit, and would not draw
            power from the rest of the air conditioning system. Many smart thermostats require power from the rest of the 
            system to remain online and connected to your wireless network (to enable all of those cool "smart" functions).
            </p>
            <p>That's where rewiring may be necessary - if the existing thermostat wiring does not include a "common" or "C wire"
            you may have to locate or add one.</p>

        <h3>Common (or "C") wire</h3>
            <p>To better understand the need for the C wire, let's look at the system as a whole. There are (unfortunately) 
            multiple types of air conditioners, each with different wiring schemes. Because I'm not an A/C technician
            we'll focus on the type I successfully rewired. A "single stage" system - one thermostat, one air handler, and one 
            condenser. The system can call for cooling, heating, or unconditioned air ("fan only").</p>
