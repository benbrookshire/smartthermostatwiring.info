    <title>Rewiring your air handler and thermostat for first time installation of a smart thermostat</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This all sounds like too much!</h1>
  <p>I felt this way too, when I removed the face plate of my old thermostat. Wire colors were unclear, and there seemed
    to be some wires missing! I explored various resources on how smart thermostats are wired, and worked up a
    basic understanding of how "single stage" air conditioners are wired up.</p>
    <p>If you're looking for a quick and simple 1-2 steps this might not be for you, but in my case there wasn't
        a 1-2 step process that would work. So let's dive in - what does it take to rewire your air handler
        to support a newer "smart" thermostat?</p>
    <h2>Quick Terminology</h2>
    <p>First, let's cover some basic terminology.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thermostat: this is the only part of your air conditioner that you typically interact with -
            typically a small white box approx. 4x6x1 inches that reads out the current room temperature
            and let's you adjust the temperature for you air conditioner, making it warmer or cooler.</li>
        <li>Air handler: this is the large unit typically hidden away inside your home in an attic or closet space.
            It draws in air from your house and cools or warms the air and passes the air through ductwork into 
            various rooms in your house.</li>
        <li>Condenser: this is the large loud unit outside your house, typically in your back or side yard. It kicks on
            at the same time as your air handler when you're cooling your house, and works together to remove heat
            from the air inside your house, and dump that heat outside.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why rewire?</h2>
    <p>In many cases rewiring your thermostat to allow installation of a smart thermostat isn't necessary. When
        would it be necessary?</p>
    <p>Old thermostats were often run off of batteries stored in the back of the thermostat unit, and would not draw
        power from the rest of the air conditioning system. Many smart thermostats require power from the rest of the 
        system to remain online and connected to your wireless network (to enable all of those cool "smart" functions).
    </p>
    <p>That's where rewiring may be necessary - if the existing thermostat wiring does not include a "common" or "C wire"
        you may have to locate or add one.</p>
    <h3>Common (or "C") wire</h3>
    <p>To better understand the need for the C wire, let's look at the system as a whole. There are (unfortunately) 
        multiple types of air conditioners, each with different wiring schemes. Because I'm not an A/C technician
        we'll focus on the type I successfully rewired. A "single stage" system - one thermostat, one air handler, and one 
        condenser. The system can call for cooling, heating, or unconditioned air ("fan only").</p>
