					<h2>Is this for me?</h2>
                        <p>Removing an old thermostat and having multi-colored wires staring back at you can feel daunting.
                            Wire colors can be unclear, and in some cases wires may be missing when you compare your new smart thermostat's
                            instructions with what you see coming out of your wall.
                        </p>
                        <p>I explored various resources on how smart thermostats are wired, and worked up a
                            basic understanding of how "single stage" air conditioners (common simple A/C and heat systems in Texas) are wired up.</p>
                        <p>If you're looking for a quick and simple 1-2 steps this information might <b>not</b> be for you, 
                            but in my case there wasn't
                            a 1-2 step process that <i>would</i> work.</p>
                        <p>So let's dive in - what does it take to rewire your air conditioning system
                            to support a newer "smart" thermostat?</p>

								</header>
								<p>This is the only part of your air conditioner that you usually interact with -
                                    typically a small white box approx. 4x6x1 inches that reads out the current room temperature
                                    and let's you adjust the temperature for your air conditioner, making it warmer or cooler.</p>

									<h3>Air Handler (sometimes called Furnace)</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This is the large unit typically hidden away inside your home in an attic or closet space.
                                    It draws in air through a vent inside your house, that air then passed through an air filter, 
                                    and is then cooled or warmed. The same air then passes 
                                    through insulated ductwork in walls and attic space into various rooms in your house.</p>

									<h3>Condenser</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This is the large (often loud) unit outside of your house, typically in a back or side yard. It kicks on
                                    at the same time as your air handler when you're cooling your house, and works together to remove heat
                                    from the air inside your house, and dump that heat outside.</p>

									<h3>Wiring</h3>
								</header>
								<p>These three systems - thermostat, air handler, and condenser all interact via stranded
                                    copper wiring that connects them. Ideally a 5-strand wire connects your thermostat with
                                    your air handler, and a 2-strand wire connects your air handler to the condenser. These wires 
                                    are not passing digital signals, they simply pass low-voltage in various closed-circuit
                                    configurations to control the three systems.</p>

						<h2>When Rewiring May Be Necessary</h2>
						<p>Rewiring may be necessary when your existing wiring is incompatible with smart thermostats.</p>
					</header>
                    
                    <div class="content">
                    
                        <p>In many cases rewiring your system to allow installation of a smart thermostat isn't necessary. When
                            would it be necessary?</p>

                        <p>There are (unfortunately) 
                        multiple types of air conditioners, each with different wiring schemes. Because I'm not an A/C technician
                        we'll focus on the type I successfully rewired. A "single stage" system - one thermostat, one air handler, and one 
                        condenser. The system can call for cooling, heating, or unconditioned air ("fan only").</p>

                        <p>Old thermostats were often run off of batteries stored in the back of the thermostat unit. The thermostat would
                            <b>not</b> draw
                        power from the rest of the air conditioning system. Many smart thermostats, however, require constant power from the 
                        rest of the system in order for the thermostat to remain online and connected to your wireless network 
                            (to enable all of those cool "smart" functions).
                        </p>

                        <p>That's where rewiring may be necessary - if your existing thermostat wiring does not include a "common" or "C-wire"
                        you may need to locate or add one a C-wire, because the C-wire is what allows your thermostat to draw constant
                            power in order to stay online.</p>

                        <h3>Locating or adding a common (or "C") wire</h3>

                            <p>In some cases, your thermostat wiring may include a C-wire that was just stuffed into the hole in the wall
                            behind your thermostat. Typically the C-wire is blue in color.</p>

                            <p>If you check and do not have any spare wires, or your spare wires are not blue, you can do some additional
                            legwork in order to find out whether you have a C-wire available. This is what I had - two sets of red &amp; white
                            wires:</p>

                        <h4>Locate and open up your air handler</h4>

                            <p>Flip the breaker (or the sometimes available power switch near the air handler itself)
                                to power off your air handler.</p> 
                            <p>Search the area for the thermostat wiring going into the air handler, and locate the removable
                            panel that will expose the interior wiring of the air handler. We're looking for the termination point of your thermostat
                            wiring.</p>

                        <h4>Map out the existing wiring of your air handler</h4>

                            <p>Take note of the termination point for each of your thermostat wires, by color.</p>

                            <p>Here's an example of the existing (non-updated) thermostat wiring terminating on an air handler
                            logic board:</p>
                            <p class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_0354.JPG"></p> <!-- existing air handler wiring -->

                            <p>If you look closely you can see partially obstructed black markings on the logic board 
                                that indicate the <b>expected</b> wiring colors:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Y - yellow</li>
                                <li>W - white</li>
                                <li>R - red</li>
                                <li>G - green</li>
                                <li>C - cyan/blue</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It's probably immediately obvious, though - almost none of the colors match up!</p>

                            <p>In order to better understand the existing wiring (which was working properly) I drew up a wiring
                            diagram:</p>
                            <p class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_5365.JPG"></p> <!-- existing wiring diagram -->

                            <p>Starting at the top, you'll see the thermostat wiring (two sets of red/white wires) does not match the color
                            scheme pictured at the air handler? How is that possible? After some digging around in the attic space, 
                            I discovered the wiring had been spliced - this is also represented in the wiring diagram.</p>

                            <p>Let's trace each wire from end to end to clarify, starting at the thermostat:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Thermostat (Y) &rarr; white wire (with Y-yellow electric tape) &rarr; attic splice (B) blue wire &rarr; 
                                    (W) white wire on the condenser line, in the air handler enclosure &rarr; Condenser (B)</li>
                                <li>Thermostat (R) &rarr; red wire &rarr; attic splice (R) red wire &rarr; black wire that routed inside
                                    the air handler to a cutoff switch and then back to the air handler logic board 
                                    &rarr; air handler logic board termination (R)</li>
                                <li>Thermostat (G) &rarr; red wire (with G-green electric tape) &rarr; attic splice (G) green wire &rarr;
                                    air handler logic board termination (G)</li>
                                <li>Thermostat (W) &rarr; white wire &rarr; attic splice (W) white white &rarr;
                                    air handler logic board termination (W)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>This covers almost all of the wires in the diagram - we're just missing the path of the other condenser wire shown.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Air handler (C) &rarr; red wire on the condenser line, in the air handler enclosure &rarr; Condenser (Y)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Here's a picture of that head-scratcher splice which I discovered buried in the attic insulation somewhere between the 
                                thermostat
                            and the air handler:</p>

                            <p class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_0356.jpg"></p> <!-- attic splice -->

                            <p>You can see the two sets of red/white on the top, and the B/G/R/W colors on the bottom. I carefully took the splice apart 
                            to determine how each color connection was matched.</p>

                        <h4>Can you use existing wiring?</h4>

                            <p>Great, now you've mapped the system's wiring. Hopefully your system's wiring was much simpler than the above example.</p>

                            <p>You can use your existing wiring if you were able to locate or identify a C-wire, which would typically be connected to 
                                the (C)
                            termination point on your air handler's logic board. In total, you'll need 5 wires connecting your thermostat to your 
                                air handler:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Y: yellow, calls for cooling, connecting thermostat (Y) &rarr; air handler (Y) ( and then on to the condenser (Y))</li>
                                <li>R: red, power/hot, connecting thermostat (R) &rarr; air handler (R)</li>
                                <li>G: green, calls for fan, connecting thermostat (G) &rarr; air handler (G)</li>
                                <li>W: white, calls for heat, connecting thermostat (W) &rarr; air handler (W)</li>
                                <li>C: blue, allows for constant power to flow through the (R)/power/hot , connecting thermostat (C) &rarr; air handler 
                                    (C)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>I noticed that when moving/pulling the spliced wires in my attic, the air handler would power off and on, 
                            indicating there was a bad splice or short in the line.
                                Based on the complexity of my wiring setup, and this problematic splice, I decided it would be easier to run a new 
                                thermostat wire between my thermostat and my air handler to "start fresh". </p>

                        <h4>Running new thermostat wire</h4>
                        
                            <p>I went down to my local hardware store to buy a rough estimated length of 5-strand thermostat wire. 25 feet of the 
                            wire cost me about $12. Measure the distance between the thermostat and air handler - don't forget to account for wall height!</p>

                            <p>To run the wire I simply tied off the end of the new thermostat wire on the existing wire coming out of the wall
                            where the thermostat hung. From the attic space, I pulled up the old wire, and the new wire came along with it. I then cut off
                            the old wire, and fished the new wire down into the existing hole in the ceiling of the air handler closet.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Rewiring the system</h4>

                            <p>From there, wiring both ends was much easier - no splices, and no color mapping. I just matched up the new wire color with
                            the air handler logic board's color markings, and the new thermostat's color markings (Y/R/G/W/C).</p>

                            <p>The only remaining challenge was properly wiring in the condenser - the condenser wire (in my case, a 2-strand wire
                            with red/white) and thermostat wire each terminate in the air handler enclosure, at the air handler logic board (as you 
                                saw above).</p>

                            <p>I traced the 2-strand red/white wire from the air handler to the condenser. To ensure I was terminating the wires
                            properly in the air handler, I turned off the condenser's breaker (this is super important - 240V!), and opened up 
                            the condenser enclosure. The condenser red/white wires were connected to yellow/blue wires:</p>

                            <p class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_0008.JPG"></p> <!-- condenser wiring -->

                            <p>That covers everything - so, here's a diagram of how I wired in the newly run thermostat wire and the existing condenser 
                                wire:</p>

                            <p class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_3041.JPG"></p> <!-- new wiring diagram -->

                            <p>Here's a picture of the newly wired air handler (again, the board's terminations are in this order: YWRGC):</p>

                            <p class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_3087.JPG"></p> <!-- new wiring diagram -->

                            <p>You can see the red wire from the condenser wired in to the (Y) termination, and the white wire from the condenser
                            wired in to the (C) termination. You also see the red wire from the thermostat running through the black wires of

							<h3>About This Page</h3>
							<p>I work for a software company in Austin, TX and I don't have any professional experience with air conditioners,
                                but I've rewired and installed thermostats on multiple houses I've owned rather than calling and A/C professional
                                to come help. All of the information provided here is as-is and is not warrantied. If you feel unsafe or unsure
                                please call an air conditioning professional for help! Air conditioning systems use high voltage electricity
                                and in some cases natural gas or propane to heat and cool - all of which are inherently dangerous!</p>
