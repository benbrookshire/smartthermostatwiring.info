					<h2>Is this for me?</h2>
                        <p>Removing an old thermostat and having multi-colored wires staring back at you can feel daunting.
                            Wire colors can be unclear, and in some cases wires may be missing when you compare a new smart thermostat's
                            instructions with what you see coming out of your wall.
                        </p>
                        <p>I explored various resources on how smart thermostats are wired, and worked up a
                            basic understanding of how "single stage" air conditioners are wired up.</p>
                        <p>If you're looking for a quick and simple 1-2 steps this information on this page might <b>not</b> be for you, 
                            but in my case there wasn't
                            a 1-2 step process that <i>would</i> work.</p>
                        <p>So let's dive in - what does it take to rewire your air handler
                            to support a newer "smart" thermostat?</p>

									<h3>Thermostat</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This is the only part of your air conditioner that you typically interact with -
                                    typically a small white box approx. 4x6x1 inches that reads out the current room temperature
                                    and let's you adjust the temperature for you air conditioner, making it warmer or cooler.</p>

									<h3>Air Handler</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This is the large unit typically hidden away inside your home in an attic or closet space.
                                    It draws in air from your house and cools or warms the air and passes the air through ductwork into 
                                    various rooms in your house.</p>

									<a href="#" class="icon fa-qrcode"><span class="label">Icon</span></a>
									<h3>Condenser</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This is the large loud unit outside your house, typically in your back or side yard. It kicks on
                                    at the same time as your air handler when you're cooling your house, and works together to remove heat
                                    from the air inside your house, and dump that heat outside.</p>

									<h3>Wiring</h3>
								</header>
								<p>These three systems - thermostat, air handler, and condenser all interact via stranded
                                    copper wiring that connects them. Ideally a 5 strand wire connects your thermostat with
                                    your air handler, and a 2 strand wire connects your air handler to the condenser. These wires 
                                    are not passing digital signals, they simple pass low-voltage in various closed-circuit
                                    configurations to control the three systems.</p>

						<h2>Why Rewiring May Be Necessary</h2>
						<p>Rewiring may be necessary when existing wiring is incompatible.</p>
					</header>
                    <p>In many cases rewiring your thermostat to allow installation of a smart thermostat isn't necessary. When
                        would it be necessary?</p>
                        <p>Old thermostats were often run off of batteries stored in the back of the thermostat unit, and would not draw
                        power from the rest of the air conditioning system. Many smart thermostats require power from the rest of the 
                        system to remain online and connected to your wireless network (to enable all of those cool "smart" functions).
                        </p>
                        <p>That's where rewiring may be necessary - if the existing thermostat wiring does not include a "common" or "C wire"
                        you may have to locate or add one.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Common (or "C") wire</h3>
                        <p>To better understand the need for the C wire, let's look at the system as a whole. There are (unfortunately) 
                        multiple types of air conditioners, each with different wiring schemes. Because I'm not an A/C technician
                        we'll focus on the type I successfully rewired. A "single stage" system - one thermostat, one air handler, and one 
                        condenser. The system can call for cooling, heating, or unconditioned air ("fan only").</p>

							<h3>About This Page</h3>
							<p>I work for a software company in Austin, TX and I don't have any professional experience with air conditioners,
                                but I've rewired and installed thermostats on multiple houses I've owned rather than calling and A/C professional
                                to come help. All of the information provided here is as-is and is not warrantied. If you feel unsafe or unsure
                                please call an air conditioning professional for help! Air conditioning systems use high voltage electricity
                                and in some cases natural gas or propane to heat and cool - all of which are inherently dangerous!</p>
